1. I go through every row and column multiple times
2. Every time, I am able to identify some spots where there definitely will be shaded and some that definitely will not be shaded based on the hints given.(for a 10 * 10 grid, if the column hint is "5 3", it is guaranteed that the boxes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 are shaded)
3. I mark them by shading if definately shaded and cross if definately not shaded
4. I keep repeating this process until all the boxes are either shaded or crossed and not empty
